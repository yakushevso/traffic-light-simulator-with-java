# Traffic Light Simulator with Java

## Project Overview
**Platform:** Hyperskill  
**Track:** Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot)  
**Project Link:** https://hyperskill.org/projects/288

### About
Do you know how traffic lights were invented? Some time ago, it was decided to replace the traffic police officers with a looped automated system that gives information to drivers about whether they can continue driving or not. In this project, we will implement a simplified version of such a system for a road junction in which many roads converge to one.

### Stages
- Open the control panel
- Set up the traffic light
- Oops, wrong button
- Like a clockwork
- Over and over again
- Red, yellow, green
